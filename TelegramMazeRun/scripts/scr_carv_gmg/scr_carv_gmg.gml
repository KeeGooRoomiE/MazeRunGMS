	There is two main variants of this generator:
	1) Default one will generate all the cells and throw them all into draw event.
	2) Slow growing one will throw 1 cell at the time. You will see how the maze grows and after it finishes it'll wait for a bit and restart.

	To enable second version, change "while" on "if" and uncomment "else" statement here and "timer" variable in "scr_init_gmg"
